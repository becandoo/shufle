## A simple, lightweight grid, built with Neat.

> Why another grid? Not everyone knows SASS and we get it.
>This is for people who want to harness the power of Bourbon's Neat, without having to know sass/scss.

### Eventually, we will add additional (optional) HTML elements to create an awesome, framework, harnessing the power of Bourbon.


1. Drop the 'grid.css' file into your CSS/Stylesheets folder.
2. Link it in your site's ```html<head>``` tag.
3. Utilize the grid in your site, with the following structure:

```html
        <div Class="grid">
          <div Class="columns-#">
          </div>
        </div>
```

4. For instance, a grid spanning 4 columns would look like this:

```html
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="columns-4"></div>
          <div class="columns-4"></div>
          <div class="columns-4"></div>
        </div>
```
*See docs/index.html for additional examples.

* Thats it! Super easy, right?
