## [Shufle](http://becandoo.github.io/shufle)

Shufle is a simple, semantic grid, based on Susy.

* Documentation
* Using the grid is simple. Drop it into your project, link your css, and (almost) done.
* To setup the grid, there are two things to know. The grid starts with a .grid class. This class is the outer container and will contain the columns nested within.
* The second thing, is the columns-# class. For instance, let's say you wanted to create a grid, spanning 4 columns in width.
* This is what this would look like:

<dl>
* <div class="grid">
*   <div class="columns-4"></div>
*   <div class="columns-4"></div>
*   <div class="columns-4"></div>
* </div>
</dl>

* Thats it! Easy peasy.
