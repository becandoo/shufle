# Shufle - A Super Simple Susy Grid

> Why another grid? Not everyone knows SASS and we get it. I didn't know about it until about a year ago, when I crawled out from under a rock.

## [Shufle](http://becandoo.github.io/shufle)

Shufle is a simple, semantic grid, based on Susy.

* Documentation
* Using the grid is simple. Drop it into your project, link your css, and (almost) done.
* To setup the grid, there are two things to know. The grid starts with a .grid class. This class is the outer container and will contain the columns nested within.
* The second thing, is the columns-# class. For instance, let's say you wanted to create a grid, spanning 4 columns in width.
* This is what this would look like:

```html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="columns-4"></div>
  <div class="columns-4"></div>
  <div class="columns-4"></div>
</div>
```

* Thats it! Super easy, right?
