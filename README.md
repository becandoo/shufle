# Shufle - A Super Simple Susy Grid

> Why another grid? Not everyone knows SASS and we get it. I didn't know about it until about a year ago, when I crawled out from under a rock.

## [Shufle](http://becandoo.github.io/shufle)

Shufle is a simple, semantic grid, based on Susy.


1. Drop the 'grid.css' file into your CSS/Stylesheets folder.
2. Link it in your site's ```html<head>``` tag.
3. Utilize the grid in your site, with the following structure:

        ```html
        <div Class="grid">
        <div Class="columns-#">
        </div>
        </div>
        ```
        
4. For instance, a grid spanning 4 columns would look like this:

        ```html
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="columns-4"></div>
          <div class="columns-4"></div>
          <div class="columns-4"></div>
        </div>
        ```
